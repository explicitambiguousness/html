<h1> Portugal - Europe’s Leading Tourism Destination at the World Travel Awards</h1>
<div><a href="text1.html">Portugal</a> won the award for Europe’s Leading Tourism Destination at the World Travel Awards, the most prestigious tourism awards, during a ceremony held in St. Petersburg, Russia.</div>
<div>The fact that Portugal won this award for the first time is evidence of the progress Portugal has made in terms of visibility and prestige as a quality destination. Only during 2017 Portugal received more than 2,300 prizes and distinctions.</div>
<div>The diversity of landscapes, the strengthening of air accessibility, the ease of travelling within the country and the friendliness and welcoming spirit of the Portuguese were definitely some of the arguments that motivated this distinction.</div>
<div>Portugal was also the country that received the most awards in this gala, with 37 distinctions ranging from Europe’s Leading Cruise Port (Lisbon), Europe’s Leading Island Destination (Madeira Islands) and Europe’s Leading Beach Destination (Algarve). Turismo de Portugal was considered Europe’s Leading Tourist Board. Portugal won 37 of the Oscars of Tourism, 13 more than in 2016, which reinforces its position as the 3rd most peaceful country in the world and the 14th most competitive country. Portugal receives every year over 21 million visitors.</div>
<div>Established In 1993, the World Travel Awards acknowledges, rewards and celebrates excellence across all key sectors of the travel, tourism and hospitality industries. Thousands of industry professionals identify the selection of nominees at an international level and choose their favourites every year.</div>
